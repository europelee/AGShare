alljoyn wrapper(just support android now), and some demo.
the wrapper provides a android service named EndPtService,
and DeviceInterace/DeviceService used to send/recv data,
all for developing quickly and easily, could care alljoyn
less, and the developer only need care (un)serializing data
from DeviceInterface/DeviceService, yes, the wrapper does 
one thing well, let app layer parsing data, modular programing,
low coupling.
